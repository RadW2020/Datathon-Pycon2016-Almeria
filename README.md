# Datathon-Pycon2016-Almeria
Part of my work for the participation in the Datathon organized by [Cajamar at the PyconES-2016-Almer√≠a](http://www.cajamardatalab.com/datathon-cajamar-pythonhack-2016/predictive-modelling/)

It's quite messy as it was done in a two nights rush.

It uses the WEKA java library in a Netbeans project
